They are tiny shards of plastic measuring up to 5mm in length. They come from everything from tires to beauty products, which contain microbeads, tiny particles used as exfoliants. Another key source is synthetic fabrics. Every time clothing is washed, the pieces shed tiny plastic fibres called microfibres – a form of microplastics. Laundry alone causes around 500,000 tonnes of plastic microfibres to be released into the ocean every year –the equivalent of almost 3 billion polyester shirts.
